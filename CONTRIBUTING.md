## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add docstrings to functions
- Keep functions focused and small
- Comment complex logic

### Example:
```python
def calculate_rolling_average(data, window_size=4):
    """
    Calculate rolling average for sales data.
    
    Args:
        data (pd.Series): Sales data
        window_size (int): Window size for rolling calculation
        
    Returns:
        pd.Series: Rolling average values
    """
    return data.rolling(window_size, min_periods=1).mean()
```

### Jupyter Notebooks
- Clear markdown explanations
- Run all cells before committing
- Include outputs for key cells
- Organize into logical sections
- Add conclusions and insights

## üß™ Testing

### Before Submitting
1. Test your changes thoroughly
2. Ensure existing functionality still works
3. Run the quick test:
```bash
python -c "import pandas as pd; df = pd.read_csv('walmart.csv'); print('‚úì Tests pass')"
```

### For New Models
- Compare with existing baselines
- Document performance metrics
- Include training time estimates
- Add memory requirements

## üìä Adding New Features

### New Machine Learning Model

```python
models = {
    'Your Model': YourModelClass(parameters),
    # ... existing models
}
```

2. Update documentation in README.md
3. Add to model comparison section
4. Include performance metrics

### New Visualizations
1. Add to `walmart_analysis.ipynb`
2. Use consistent styling
3. Add titles and labels
4. Save high-quality images (300 DPI)
5. Update README with new visualization

### New Features (Data Engineering)
1. Add feature creation in feature engineering section
2. Document the rationale
3. Test impact on model performance
4. Update feature list in documentation
